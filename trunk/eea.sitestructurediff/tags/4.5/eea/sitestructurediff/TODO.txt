* Todo and bugs:
    -- Tests are working with modifications, when the other bugs are fixed
    maybe the tests will be able to look exactly as they did in plone2

    -- Cache doesn't seem to invalidate after the end of the sync method, right
    now I need to restart server to see changes in @@sitemap-diff jstree

    -- Node numbers in parenthesis aren't displaying properly the number of
    translations that an object already has ex (0/4) when when I am missing
    only one so it should display (3/4), this behaviour is present even on
    the old site, so a logic reevaluation will be required

    -- Right now the jstree layout is presenting arrows for all folders even
    if those folders don't actually contain any children

* Fixed issues:
    -- Chrome sometimes saw NODE as an array containing the object
    instead of the object directly, which resulted in no syncing

    -- Image icon url for folder or topics aren't saved, you have the height
    and width but the image isn't there in the tree of the @@sitemap-diff
        -- made a function that creates the path to the image without using
                                        the icon from portal_types icon_expr

    -- Sync Translations isn't doing anything, the js isn't calling anything
    through ajax, so this feature looks incomplete
        -- made a new method syncTranslation that is retranslating the
        translated objects title excepting the one that is selected from jstree

    -- When syncing content and I had three languages,
    synccontext.addTranslation() modified first language object if there were
    more than 1 language to translate into, and it always returned a dict with
    only two entries (it worked when I had four languages, need more testing)
        -- I couldn't get this behaviour on future tries, I've made some changes
        to the code, so I am declaring this issue as fixed
